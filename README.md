# 🔱 Silentum Spoofer - HWID Bypass

**Specifically optimized to deep-clean and randomize all hardware traces for maximum invisibility.**

## ⚠️ ANTIVIRUS & "FALSE POSITIVE" WARNING

When you download or run Silentum, **Antivirus software (Windows Defender, etc.) will flag it as a threat.**

### **Is it safe?**
**Yes.** This is a "False Positive". Silentum does NOT contain any malicious code.

### **Why is it flagged?**
1. **Registry Access**: The tool must modify system registry keys to change your Hardware ID. Antiviruses monitor these keys and block any app that touches them.
2. **Hardware Spoofing**: Changing MAC addresses and Disk Serials is considered "malicious behavior" by generic security scanners.
3. **Packaging**: The EXE version is packed to include all dependencies, which often triggers "Heuristic" detections.

### **How to use safely:**
- **Disable Real-Time Protection** before running.
- **Add an Exception** for the Silentum folder.
- **Run as Administrator** to allow registry modifications.
